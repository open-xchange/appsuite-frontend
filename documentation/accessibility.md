# Overview

[Web accessibility][WCAG-INTRO] aims at helping users with disabilities to access the web, i.e. perceiving and interacting with web sites or web-based applications. In order to offer everyone – with or without disabilities – the best possible user experience, we continually strive to meet the [Level AA conformance][WCAG-WAI] as defined by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines][WCAG-TR] 2.1.

Accessibility typically covers keyboard support, tab order, focus management, color contrast, semantic markup, WAI-ARIA support, and screen reader support.

We perform screen reader testing with the following typical setups on desktop devices: [NVDA][NVDA] with Firefox, [JAWS][Jaws] with Microsoft Edge and [Voiceover][VO] with Safari (with accessibility option turned on, i.e. tab highlights each item).

Automated testing with [axe-core][AXE] is also part of e2e tests in our build pipeline.

Annual accessibility audits are conducted by [the Paciello Group][TPG] or [DEQUE][DQ].
