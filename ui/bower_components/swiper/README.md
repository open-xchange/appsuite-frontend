==========

It is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. Designed mostly for iOS, but also works great on latest Android, Windows Phone 8 and modern Desktop browsers

Swiper is not compatible with all platforms, it is a modern touch slider which is focused only on modern apps/platforms to bring the best experience and simplicity.

# Dist / Build

On production use files (JS and CSS) only from `dist/` folder, there will be the most stable versions, `build/` folder is only for development purpose

### Build

Swiper uses `gulp` to build a development (build) and dist versions.

First you need to have `gulp-cli` which you should install globally.

```
$ npm install --global gulp
```

Then install all dependencies, in repo's root:

```
$ npm install
```

And build development version of Swiper:
```
$ gulp build
```

The result is available in `build/` folder.

### Dist/Release

After you have made build:

```
$ gulp dist
```

Distributable version will available in `dist/` folder.

# Contributing

All changes should be commited to `src/` files. Swiper uses LESS for CSS compliations, and concatenated JS files (look at gulpfile.js for concat files order)
